Intranets are private internal networks that increase the engagement of the employees to work together across roles, departments and locations.
The main purposes of intranets are: 
-Easily getting information around to everyone
-Sportsmanship and teamwork of employees
-Speeding up task completion and workflow

There is a nice diagram to visually understand how an intranet works

Underneath the diagram it explains that there is a network circle that only the company and its employees can access which then protects the data of the intranet from the internet with a firewall so that no one can access anything on the network. Only those directly connected to the network can access the information being transferred, so that itâ€™s secure from any outside personnel.
Intranet is important because it gets information around and greatly improves productivity and decreases confusion between the company and the employees.
